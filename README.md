# Traffic-signs-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-network
Traffic signs recognition plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Some of the key roles of traffic signs detection are Driver assistance and autonomous driving. In this paper we propose aÂ  Convolutional Neural Network model which can classify and detect traffic signs with high speed and high accuracy. The proposed model is trained, tested and evaluated by using the German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark(GTSRB). The dataset is initially preprocessed for training the model, in the second stage the data is classified by using the proposed CNN model into different classes, In the final stage the model is tested for predicting the real time accuracy. We are using Keras library for the application of CNN model. This model has shown significant results when tested against the GTSRB by achieving an accuracy of 98.43%.
